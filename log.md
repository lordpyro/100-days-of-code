# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 14, 2017 (Example 1)

Today's Progress: Worked on some of the FreeCode Camp's Javascript projects, Created a responsive form and input area with text box in Bootstrap.Js. Used a few tags. 
Thoughts: I am glad I found this. This is an excellent way to make sure I am learning. Going through online courses can fool you into thinking you know it because your mind understands it. Writing it is a totally different manner and doing it everyday will accelerate the process.
