# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 14, 2017 (Example 1)

Today's Progress: Worked on some of the FreeCode Camp's Javascript projects, Created a responsive form and input area with text box in Bootstrap.Js. Used a few tags. 
Thoughts: I am glad I found this. This is an excellent way to make sure I am learning. Going through online courses can fool you into thinking you know it because your mind understands it. Writing it is a totally different manner and doing it everyday will accelerate the process.

### Day 2: February 15, 2017

# Today's Progress:
Finished up a rudimentary game in CodeAcademy using functions, and nested if/then statements

# Thoughts:
Realizing the importance of going over these things. Thankfully i have 98 more days!
 
I only did a tiny bit of code on the 16th because I wasn't feeling well.

### Day 3: February 17th, 2017
I finished up a Codeacademy course on functions which were a few exercises, and I started in on the Arrays section. I also
read the Functions page on MDN, as well as the Array chapter on A Smarter Way to Learn Javascript.
